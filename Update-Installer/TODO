Nice To Have
============

Update size:
 * Support for applying binary patches (eg. with bspatch/bsdiff)
 * Try using bzip2 compression instead of standard zip compression
   (requires recent version of zip/unzip tools) [done]

Telemetry:
 * Call a project-specific URL to report successful/failed update installation
   and starting of new app after update

Source:
 * Ensure no Mendeley branding in standalone project and publish code [done - left Mendeley icons in
   code and make a note that anyone re-using the code will need to replace them]

Reliability:
 * Create a lock to prevent Mendeley being started whilst updates are
   in progress and to prevent multiple updates being run at once.
 * Consider using file system transactions on Windows to make update installation atomic
